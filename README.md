# Alloy

Alloy is a superset that combines Rust with the ergonomics and expressiveness of Swift and TypeScript. It aims to provide a more intuitive programming experience while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees and performance.

## Language Design

1. More expressive type inference (from Swift and TypeScript)
2. Optional chaining and null coalescing operators (from Swift)
3. Union types and type narrowing (from TypeScript)
4. Trailing closures and Guards (from Swift)
5. Explicit side effect tracking

## Usage

To use Alloy, you need to have Rust's nightly toolchain installed, as it uses the `box_patterns` feature which is not yet stabilized.

Alloy is released under the MPL-2.0 License.
